== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What makes this plugin different from other optimization plugins? =

We just bring some helper functions from our core theme and release it under a single plugin. There is big advantage when using it with your theme, but it should be better.

= Do I need any specific theme to work with? =

It depends your choices. Our suggestion is trying with a theme which has no page builder, because we provide a setting to disable Gutenberg. Right now this plugin has been integrated with all our themes as well.
